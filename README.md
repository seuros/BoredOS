## History

**BoredOS** is the successor to **[BrewKernel](https://github.com/boreddevnl/brewkernel)**, a project started in 2023. BrewKernel served as the foundational learning ground but has since been officially deprecated and archived — it no longer receives updates, bug fixes, or pull request reviews.

BoredOS is a complete architectural reboot, applying years of lessons learned to build a cleaner, more modular, and more capable system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please direct all issues, discussions, and contributions to this repository. Legacy BrewKernel code is preserved for historical purposes only and is not compatible with BoredOS.
