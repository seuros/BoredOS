## Features

### Kernel and Architecture
- **Long Mode (x86_64)** 
- **SMP** — Multi-core with IPI-based scheduling and cross-core synchronization
- **Memory Management** — Slab allocator with object pooling; handles physical/virtual mapping
- **VFS** — Unified interface over FAT32, TAR, ProcFS, and SysFS
- **Preemptive Scheduling** — Priority-based, with full context isolation per process
- **Hardware Support** — PCI, AHCI, PS/2, ACPI drivers
- **Virtual Terminals** — 10 independent TTYs (`/dev/tty1`–`/dev/tty10`), each with its own graphics buffer

### Display & Compositing
- **Nova Compositor** — Userland window server over a UNIX socket (`/tmp/nova.sock`)
- **Framebuffer** — `/dev/fb0` for direct pixel access and mode switching
- **Window Management** — Layered rendering, decorations, focus, and client event routing
- **Input Routing** — Keyboard and mouse via `/dev/keyboard` and `/dev/mouse`

### Networking
- **TCP/IP** — lwIP stack with DHCP, DNS, and Berkeley sockets
- **Utilities** — `ping`, `curl`, `telnet`

### Applications

## History

**BoredOS** is the successor to **[BrewKernel](https://github.com/boreddevnl/brewkernel)**, a project started in 2023. BrewKernel served as the foundational learning ground but has since been officially deprecated and archived — it no longer receives updates, bug fixes, or pull request reviews.

BoredOS is a complete architectural reboot, applying years of lessons learned to build a cleaner, more modular, and more capable system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please direct all issues, discussions, and contributions to this repository. Legacy BrewKernel code is preserved for historical purposes only and is not compatible with BoredOS.
